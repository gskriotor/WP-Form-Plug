# WP-Form-Plug
This is reference code for a WordPress multi-step registration form plugin. It can be modified to fit most WordPress form needs. There is some basic wp user based database functionality for registration, updating and metadata. 

The HTML, CSS and Javascript were pulled from w3schools:

This uses jQuery, but it is included via the wp enqueue script function that is native to WordPress.
